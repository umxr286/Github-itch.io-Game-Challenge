🎮 About the Game

Wave Breaker is a modern, FX-heavy twist on the classic Breakout-style game. Everything is powered by clean, pure HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript — no engines, no frameworks.

• Begin coding core mechanics. The theme “Waves” is represented through: • Dynamic flowing brick movement • Water distortion shader • Ripple + shockwave effects • Boss waves every 5 levels • Neon trails & splash particles • Chain-reaction wave explosions

• Start asset creation (art, sound, UI). It’s designed to feel fast, smooth, and visually fluid — like an arcade game made of water.
